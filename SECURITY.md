# JME OSS Security Policy

## Overview

This security policy outlines the process for reporting security issues in JME Open Source repositories.

## Supported Version Policy

- **Releases:** New versions of jEAP microservice examples are continuously released as features and fixes are developed.
  Each release includes all security fixes implemented up to that point.
- **Version Support:** Security patches are only provided for the latest release version.
- **Security SLA:** No security Service Level Agreement (SLA) is provided.

## Reporting Security Issues

The JME maintainers take security issues seriously, and we appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose
any findings. Please DO NOT disclose potential issues publicly until we've had a chance to fix it.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/jme-admin-ch/jme/security/advisories/new) feature.

The JME maintainers will respond with the next steps for handling your report. After the initial reply, the maintainers
will keep you informed about progress toward a fix and public announcement. They may also request additional information
or guidance. Please do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities until we have had the opportunity to investigate and
resolve them.

Please note that we are currently unable to offer a bug bounty program, and external contributions are not possible at
this time. Therefore, we ask that you refrain from including code fixes in your initial report. Reproducers and detailed
descriptions are welcome.

Report security bugs in third-party modules or dependencies to the person or team maintaining the respective module.

Thank you for helping make our project more secure.
